# Prompt Routing Configuration v1
#
# This file defines how the bot resolves prompts based on context.
# Patterns are matched top-to-bottom; first match wins.
#
# Available variables:
# - {category}      : discussion, meeting, moderation
# - {channel}       : channel name (e.g., general, announcements)
# - {summary_type}  : brief, detailed, comprehensive

# Channel-specific overrides (highest priority)
prompts/{category}/{channel}.md

# Category-specific prompts
prompts/{category}/default.md

# Global fallback
prompts/default.md
